### typescript terms
1. **Variables**: These are like the rooms in a house, storing different items (data).
 
2. **Types**: Think of them as regulations for constructing rooms; for example, a bathroom (string) can't have a kitchen stove (number).

3. **Interface**: This is akin to a design plan for a specific room detailing what furniture it should contain.

4. **Classes**: Imagine a prototype for standard rooms which can be replicated in multiple houses.

5. **Functions**: These are the construction crew, executing tasks like building walls or installing plumbing.

6. **Generics**: Customizable room designs, where you choose certain elements, like paint colours, beforehand.

7. **Modules**: Separate units of the house, like the main building, the garage, and the guest house.

8. **Decorators**: Special designs or add-ons for your rooms, like mouldings or special window treatments.

9. **Access Modifiers**: Rules on who can enter rooms (private rooms like bedrooms vs. public spaces like the living room).

10. **Enums**: A catalogue of standard room designs you can choose from, be it a Victorian bedroom or a modern kitchen.

11. **Type Inference**: Intuitively knowing you need a dining table in the dining room without being told. TypeScript often "guesses" the type of a variable based on how the code is written.

12. **Union Types**: Like multi-purpose rooms, where a space can be either a study or a guest room.

13. **Type Guards**: Safety checks for rooms. Before you start cooking in a kitchen, you ensure it's not a bathroom.

14. **Type Aliases**: Giving shorthand names to complex room layouts, making it easier to reference them.

15. **Async/Await**: Similar to hiring specialists for tasks sequentially. Electricians come after the walls are up, not before.

16. **Promises**: Like scheduling multiple crews for the future; once the foundation is ready, the bricklayers and roofers will do their jobs.

17. **Tuples**: Specific room arrangements. For instance, a suite always has a bedroom followed by a bathroom.

18. **Readonly Modifier**: A room's feature that can't be changed, like a built-in fireplace.

19. **Mapped Types**: Transforming rooms based on a plan, like converting all bedrooms to studios.

20. **Namespaces**: Designating areas of the house for specific activities – East Wing for relaxation and West Wing for work.

21. **Export & Import**: Moving furniture between rooms or even houses, making elements from one module available in another.

22. **Type Assertion**: Explicitly stating a room's purpose even if it looks different; a room with a bed can be a study if we say so.

23. **Optional Parameters & Properties**: Features in a room that are nice to have but aren't mandatory, like a reading nook in a bedroom.

24. **Type Compatibility**: Checking if a chair design fits multiple room styles – TypeScript checks if one type is compatible with another.

25. **Abstract Classes**: Base designs for rooms that aren't built but serve as a foundation for other room designs.

26. **Constructors**: The foundational step in room creation, setting initial parameters like dimensions or wall colors.

27. **Static Properties**: Shared features across multiple rooms, like a central HVAC system.

28. **Getters & Setters**: Doors and windows control the access and view into a room, adjusting what you can see and change.

29. **Extending Classes**: Adding an extension to an existing room design. If you have a basic bedroom blueprint, extending it might mean adding an ensuite bathroom.

30. **Implements Keyword**: A guarantee that a house will have certain features. If a design says it implements a garden, there must be a garden in the plans.

31. **Any Type**: A multi-purpose room that can change based on needs, from a study today to a playroom tomorrow.

32. **Never Type**: A room that’s never meant to be occupied, perhaps a theoretical space for planning.

33. **Void**: A room with no specific purpose or returns nothing, like a vacant room.

34. **Type Predicates**: Verifying room specifics: ensuring that a dining room can accommodate a certain number of people.

35. **Literal Types**: Precise room definitions, like specifying a “children’s bedroom” instead of just “bedroom”.

36. **Intersection Types**: A fusion of two room designs, creating a unique space, like a kitchen-dining combo.

37. **Typeof & Keyof**: Inspecting room features. If you ask for the type of living room, you'll get its layout and size. 

38. **Type Guards**: Ensuring you're in the right room before performing an action, like ensuring you're in the kitchen before you start cooking.

39. **Ambient Declarations**: Existing house structures you acknowledge but don't modify, like a historical monument next to your property.

40. **Generics with Constraints**: Customizable rooms that have certain rules, like a personalized study that must have a window.

41. **Decorator Factories**: Advanced design add-ons tailored to your specifications, like custom wall murals.

42. **Indexed Access Types**: Accessing specific features of a room, like the exact type of windows in the bedroom.

43. **Conditional Types**: Designs that change based on conditions. If space permits, add a balcony; otherwise, add a larger window.

44. **Overloads**: Having multiple design plans for the same room depending on needs; for instance, a guest room that can be a single, double, or suite.

45. **Module Resolution**: Deciding where in the house each piece of furniture belongs, ensuring everything fits perfectly.

46. **Triple-Slash Directives**: Instructions at the beginning of a blueprint, hinting how different plans fit together.

47. **Async Iterators**: Like planning sequential tasks: once the foundation is dry, start the walls; once the walls are up, begin roofing.

48. **Strict Property Initialization**: Ensuring every room has its essential features before it's considered complete, like a bathroom having a sink.

49. **Public, Private, and Protected Modifiers**: Who gets to access which parts of the house; The family gets bedrooms (private), guests can access the living room (public), and perhaps only adults get access to the wine cellar (protected).

50. **Readonly Array Types**: An array of immutable items, akin to a display of antiques that can be viewed but not modified.

51. **Mapped Types with an As Clause**: Redesigning rooms based on a specific theme, like changing a room's furniture to suit a 'retro' theme.

52. **Rest Parameters and Tuples**: Allowing for flexibility in room size and features, like a room that can expand or contract based on the number of occupants.

53. **BigInt**: Handling larger constructs, like a blueprint for a mansion as opposed to a regular house.

54. **String Enums**: Labeling rooms with specific names, e.g., "Master Bedroom" or "Grand Hall".

55. **Numeric Separators**: Providing clarity in large numbers, like counting bricks in thousands with ease: 1_000 vs. 1000.

56. **Optional Chaining**: Checking if a feature in a room exists before accessing it, like ensuring there's a bookshelf before reaching for a book.

57. **Nullish Coalescing**: Choosing an alternative design if the primary choice is unavailable, similar to selecting a different paint color if the first choice is out of stock.

58. **Symbol**: Unique identification marks on custom furniture, ensuring they're distinct from regular items.

59. **Mixins**: Merging features from two different room designs into one, creating a unique, hybrid room.

60. **Abstract Construct Signatures**: Conceptualizing a unique feature without finalizing its design, like planning an innovative fireplace without deciding its exact look.
